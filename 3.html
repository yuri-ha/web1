<p>1. THE PROCESS SHOULD MORPH TO FIT THE PROJECT
When it comes to product design process, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. The process employed should be tailored to fit the project’s particular needs, both business and functional. Here are just a few factors that can affect the design process:

customer’s needs or preferences;
how much time you have (the project’s deadline);
project’s budget (for example, a limited budget won’t allow you to conduct a lot of interviews).
A process tailored to the capabilities of the business and of users is most effective. Thus, use what works the best for your project, get rid of the rest, and evolve your design process as the product evolves.</p>
